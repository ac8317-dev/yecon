    Android QuickBootManager apk

These are release note for QuickBootManager, explain the functions
it supports and the flow it runs.

WHAT IS QuickBootManager?

    QuickBootManager is mainly a broadcast receiver, when
    autochips.intent.action.QB_POWEROFF and autochips.intent.action.QB_POWERON
    are send, it would be triggered. The autochips.intent.action.QB_POWEROFF
    would kill the apps which NOT in whitelist, then the
    autochips.intent.action.QB_POWERON maybe restart the 3rd party app if it
    is top task when poweroff(this feature could be controlled by property).

BROADCAST REGISTER PATTERNS:

  - static register
    This pattern uses staticrecv/AndroidManifest.xml and
    src/com/autochips/staticrecv/Config.java files when compile.

  or

  - dynamic register
    This pattern uses dynamicrecv/AndroidManifest.xml and
    src/com/autochips/dynamicrecv/Config.java files when compile. It would add
    a service process to do register movement.

  Above could refer to Android.mk, the USE_STATIC_BROADCAST_RECV could control.

WHITELIST:

    List in res/values/strings.xml. The listed package names would NOT be killed
    when poweroff. Users could modify it, then recompile.

START APP ONRESUME PROPERTY:

    The 3rd party app if it is top task when poweroff would be restart on poweron.
    The ro.qb.startapp_onresume=1 could enable this feature, otherwise disabled.

    - USE_STATIC_BROADCAST_RECV in Android.mk
